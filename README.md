# GatlingLoadTesting

This repository includs everything you need to run Gatling load test.

Gatling binaries are under gatling-bundled folder, however, there're only two script files you need to modify to suit your specific needs under gatling-bundled/user-files:

	•	runSimulations.sh - directly under “user-files”
	•	lrexternal.scala - residing under "simulations/lrexternal"

You can alway get the latest version of Gatling if you need to by downloading from: https://gatling.io/download/
